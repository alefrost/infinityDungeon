		You are the green <span class="player">@</span>. Your goal is to defeat all the red <span class="enemy">e</span>'s on the map. Use Arrow keys to move (you might have to click on the map first to get it to work). Move onto an '<span class="enemy">e</span>' to attack. Be careful, the enemies move after you and will attack you as well!
